# CountriesAndAreas

Hi,

I wrote this programme to learn web scraping. Its purpose is to find the number of countries that can fit inside of the country given by the user.

It uses Pandas and Pickling. The lists are in ascending order as they're found on the site I scrape from. I have a couple ideas on how to expand this project (like ask the user if they want to sort by areas ascending or descending). If you're reading this please bare that in mind but if you have any ideas then let me know via email tomshort3@gmail.com.

Thanks,

Tom
